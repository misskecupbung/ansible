### Inventory files
Default inventory files on `/etc/ansible/hosts`. You can spesifically the inventory file, eg:
```
mkdir ~/deploy-manage
cd ~/deploy-manage
vi inventory
...
[myself]
localhost

[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[dbservers]
10.0.0.10
10.0.0.11

[hosts:children]
webservers
dbservers
...
```

How to testing
```
ansible myself --list-hosts -i inventory
ansible webservers --list-hosts
ansible all --list-hosts
```


### Files Configuration 
Default ansible package provides files on `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`. Will use if no other configuration files found.
```
vim ansible.cfg
...
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = someuser
ask_pass = false

[privilege_escalation]
become = true
become_method = sudo
become_user = root
become_ask_pass = true
...
```
Explanation:
* `inventory`: Spesific path
* `remote_user`: user to login on the spesific managed hosts. If not set, the current user will be used.
* `ask_pass`: whether or not to prompt for ssh password. Set false if using pubkey auth.
* `become`: whether is false or true to automatically switch user on the managed host.
* `become_method`: how to switch user, can set with `sudo` or `su`
* `become_user`: the user  to switch on managed host.
* `become_ask_password`: whether to prompt for your `become_method` . Default false.

Add note:

```
visudo
...
someuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
...
```

Protocol used by ansible to connect to managed hosts is set by default to `smart`.

```
ansible localhost --list-hosts
```
