### Ansible Playbooks and Ad Hoc Commands

* Ad Hoc Command: single and simple task.
* Play : ordered set of task run against hosts selected from your inventory. It allow you to change a lengthy and complex task.
* Playbook: test file containing a list of one or more plays to run in a spesific container.

Examples:
Ad Hoc Command :
```
ansible -m user -a "name=newbie uid=4000 state=present" web1.example.com
```
If we want to change to the playbooks file:
```
---
- name: Configure important user consistently
  hosts: web1.example.com
  tasks:
    - name: newbie exists with UID 4000
      user:
        name: newbie
        uid: 4000
        state: present
```

A playbook is written in YAML format, and normally saved with the extention `.yml` . The playbook used indentation with space characters to indicate the structure of its data, rules:
* Data element at the same leve in the hierarchy (such as items in the same list) must have same indentation.
* Items that are children of another item must be indented more than their parents.

Another playbooks example:
```
---
tasks:
  - name: webserver is enabled
    service:
      name: httpd
      enable: true
  - name: ntp service is enabled
    service:
      name: chronyd
      enabled: true
  - name: postfix
    service: postfix
    enabled: true
```
