### Ansible Playbooks and Ad Hoc Commands

* Ad Hoc Command: single and simple task.
* Play : ordered set of task run against hosts selected from your inventory. It allow you to change a lengthy and complex task.
* Playbook: test file containing a list of one or more plays to run in a spesific container.

Examples:
Ad Hoc Command :
```
ansible -m user -a "name=newbie uid=4000 state=present" web1.example.com
```
If we want to change to the playbook file:
```
---
- name: Configure important user consistently
  hosts: web1.example.com
  tasks:
    - name: newbie exists with UID 4000
      user:
        name: newbie
        uid: 4000
        state: present
```

A playbook is written in YAML format, and normally saved with the extention `.yml` . The playbook used indentation with space characters to indicate the structure of its data, rules:
* Data element at the same leve in the hierarchy (such as items in the same list) must have same indentation.
* Items that are children of another item must be indented more than their parents.

Another playbook example:
```
---
tasks:
  - name: webserver is enabled
    service:
      name: httpd
      enable: true
  - name: ntp service is enabled
    service:
      name: chronyd
      enabled: true
  - name: postfix
    service: postfix
    enabled: true
```


### Running Playbooks

If we want to running playbooks file, we can use the command `ansible-playbook`, example:
```
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

If you want to provide additional information:

| Option | Description |
| -------| ----------- |
| -v | the stask result are displayed |
| -vv | Both task results and task configuration are displayed |
| -vvv | Includes information about connections to managed hosts |
| -vvvv | Add extra verbosity options to the connection plugins, including users being used in the managed hosts to execute scripts, and what script have been executed |

How to check valid syntax in ansible playbooks :
```
ansible-playbook --syntax-check site.yml
```

How to report that the task would effect a change on the managed host :
```
ansible-playbook -c site.yml
```

Example playbook to install httpd package :

```
---
- name: Install and start apache HTTPD
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: httpd package is present
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: correct index.html is present
      copy:
        src: files/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html

    - name: httpd is started
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enable: true
```
Make sure the playbook is correct:
```
ansible-playbook --syntax-check site.yml
```
